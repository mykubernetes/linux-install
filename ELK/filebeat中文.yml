################### Filebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Filebeat ######################################
filebeat:
  # List of prospectors to fetch data.
  prospectors:
    # Each - is a prospector. Below are the prospector specific configurations
    -
      # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
      # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
      # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
      # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
      # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
      # 指定要监控的日志，可以指定具体得文件或者目录
      paths:
        - /var/log/*.log
        #- c:\programdata\elasticsearch\logs\*

      # Configure the file encoding for reading files with international characters
      # following the W3C recommendation for HTML5 (http://www.w3.org/TR/encoding).
      # Some sample encodings:
      #   plain, utf-8, utf-16be-bom, utf-16be, utf-16le, big5, gb18030, gbk,
      #    hz-gb-2312, euc-kr, euc-jp, iso-2022-jp, shift-jis, ...
      # 指定被监控的文件的编码类型，使用plain和utf-8都是可以处理中文日志的
      #encoding: plain

      # Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
      # The different types cannot be mixed in one prospector
      #
      # Possible options are:
      # * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
      # * stdin: Reads the standard in
      # 指定文件的输入类型log(默认)或者stdin
      input_type: log

      # Exclude lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It drops the lines that are
      # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
      # 在输入中排除符合正则表达式列表的那些行。
      # exclude_lines. By default, no lines are dropped.
      # exclude_lines: ["^DBG"]

      # Include lines. A list of regular expressions to match. It exports the lines that are
      # matching any regular expression from the list. The include_lines is called before
      # exclude_lines. By default, all the lines are exported.
      # 包含输入中符合正则表达式列表的那些行（默认包含所有行），include_lines执行完毕之后会执行exclude_lines
      # include_lines: ["^ERR", "^WARN"]

      # Exclude files. A list of regular expressions to match. Filebeat drops the files that
      # are matching any regular expression from the list. By default, no files are dropped.
      # 忽略掉符合正则表达式列表的文件
      # exclude_files: [".gz$"]

      # Optional additional fields. These field can be freely picked
      # to add additional information to the crawled log files for filtering
      # 向输出的每一条日志添加额外的信息，比如“level:debug”，方便后续对日志进行分组统计。
      # 默认情况下，会在输出信息的fields子目录下以指定的新增fields建立子目录，例如fields.level
      # 这个得意思就是会在es中多添加一个字段，格式为 "filelds":{"level":"debug"}
      #fields:
      #  level: debug
      #  review: 1

      # Set to true to store the additional fields as top level fields instead
      # of under the "fields" sub-dictionary. In case of name conflicts with the
      # fields added by Filebeat itself, the custom fields overwrite the default
      # fields.
      # 如果该选项设置为true，则新增fields成为顶级目录，而不是将其放在fields目录下。
      # 自定义的field会覆盖filebeat默认的field
      # 如果设置为true，则在es中新增的字段格式为："level":"debug"
      #fields_under_root: false

      # Ignore files which were modified more then the defined timespan in the past.
      # In case all files on your system must be read you can set this value very large.
      # Time strings like 2h (2 hours), 5m (5 minutes) can be used.
      # 可以指定Filebeat忽略指定时间段以外修改的日志内容，比如2h（两个小时）或者5m(5分钟)。
      #ignore_older: 0

      # Close older closes the file handler for which were not modified
      # for longer then close_older
      # Time strings like 2h (2 hours), 5m (5 minutes) can be used.
      # 如果一个文件在某个时间段内没有发生过更新，则关闭监控的文件handle。默认1h
      #close_older: 1h

      # Type to be published in the 'type' field. For Elasticsearch output,
      # the type defines the document type these entries should be stored
      # in. Default: log
      # 设定Elasticsearch输出时的document的type字段 可以用来给日志进行分类。Default: log
      #document_type: log

      # Scan frequency in seconds.
      # How often these files should be checked for changes. In case it is set
      # to 0s, it is done as often as possible. Default: 10s
      # Filebeat以多快的频率去prospector指定的目录下面检测文件更新（比如是否有新增文件）
      # 如果设置为0s，则Filebeat会尽可能快地感知更新（占用的CPU会变高）。默认是10s
      #scan_frequency: 10s

      # Defines the buffer size every harvester uses when fetching the file
      # 每个harvester监控文件时，使用的buffer的大小
      #harvester_buffer_size: 16384

      # Maximum number of bytes a single log event can have
      # All bytes after max_bytes are discarded and not sent. The default is 10MB.
      # This is especially useful for multiline log messages which can get large.
      # 日志文件中增加一行算一个日志事件，max_bytes限制在一次日志事件中最多上传的字节数，多出的字节会被丢弃
      #max_bytes: 10485760

      # Mutiline can be used for log messages spanning multiple lines. This is common
      # for Java Stack Traces or C-Line Continuation
      # 适用于日志中每一条日志占据多行的情况，比如各种语言的报错信息调用栈
      #multiline:

        # The regexp Pattern that has to be matched. The example pattern matches all lines starting with [
        # 多行日志开始的那一行匹配的pattern
        #pattern: ^\[

        # Defines if the pattern set under pattern should be negated or not. Default is false.
        # 是否需要对pattern条件转置使用，不翻转设为true，反转设置为false。  【建议设置为true】
        #negate: false

        # Match can be set to "after" or "before". It is used to define if lines should be append to a pattern
        # that was (not) matched before or after or as long as a pattern is not matched based on negate.
        # Note: After is the equivalent to previous and before is the equivalent to to next in Logstash
        # 匹配pattern后，与前面（before）还是后面（after）的内容合并为一条日志
        #match: after

        # The maximum number of lines that are combined to one event.
        # In case there are more the max_lines the additional lines are discarded.
        # Default is 500
        # 合并的最多行数（包含匹配pattern的那一行）
        #max_lines: 500

        # After the defined timeout, an multiline event is sent even if no new pattern was found to start a new event
        # Default is 5s.
        # 到了timeout之后，即使没有匹配一个新的pattern（发生一个新的事件），也把已经匹配的日志事件发送出去
        #timeout: 5s

      # Setting tail_files to true means filebeat starts readding new files at the end
      # instead of the beginning. If this is used in combination with log rotation
      # this can mean that the first entries of a new file are skipped.
      # 如果设置为true，Filebeat从文件尾开始监控文件新增内容，把新增的每一行文件作为一个事件依次发送，
      # 而不是从文件开始处重新发送所有内容
      #tail_files: false

      # Backoff values define how agressively filebeat crawls new files for updates
      # The default values can be used in most cases. Backoff defines how long it is waited
      # to check a file again after EOF is reached. Default is 1s which means the file
      # is checked every second if new lines were added. This leads to a near real time crawling.
      # Every time a new line appears, backoff is reset to the initial value.
      # Filebeat检测到某个文件到了EOF（文件结尾）之后，每次等待多久再去检测文件是否有更新，默认为1s
      #backoff: 1s

      # Max backoff defines what the maximum backoff time is. After having backed off multiple times
      # from checking the files, the waiting time will never exceed max_backoff idenependent of the
      # backoff factor. Having it set to 10s means in the worst case a new line can be added to a log
      # file after having backed off multiple times, it takes a maximum of 10s to read the new line
      # Filebeat检测到某个文件到了EOF之后，等待检测文件更新的最大时间，默认是10秒
      #max_backoff: 10s

      # The backoff factor defines how fast the algorithm backs off. The bigger the backoff factor,
      # the faster the max_backoff value is reached. If this value is set to 1, no backoff will happen.
      # The backoff value will be multiplied each time with the backoff_factor until max_backoff is reached
      # 定义到达max_backoff的速度，默认因子是2，到达max_backoff后，变成每次等待max_backoff那么长的时间才backoff一次，
      # 直到文件有更新才会重置为backoff
      # 根据现在的默认配置是这样的，每隔1s检测一下文件变化，如果连续检测两次之后文件还没有变化，下一次检测间隔时间变为10s
      #backoff_factor: 2

      # This option closes a file, as soon as the file name changes.
      # This config option is recommended on windows only. Filebeat keeps the files it's reading open. This can cause
      # issues when the file is removed, as the file will not be fully removed until also Filebeat closes
      # the reading. Filebeat closes the file handler after ignore_older. During this time no new file with the
      # same name can be created. Turning this feature on the other hand can lead to loss of data
      # on rotate files. It can happen that after file rotation the beginning of the new
      # file is skipped, as the reading starts at the end. We recommend to leave this option on false
      # but lower the ignore_older value to release files faster.
      # 这个选项关闭一个文件,当文件名称的变化。#该配置选项建议只在windows
      #force_close_files: false

    # Additional prospector
    #-
      # Configuration to use stdin input
      #input_type: stdin

  # General filebeat configuration options
  #
  # Event count spool threshold - forces network flush if exceeded
  # spooler的大小，spooler中的事件数量超过这个阈值的时候会清空发送出去（不论是否到达超时时间）
  #spool_size: 2048

  # Enable async publisher pipeline in filebeat (Experimental!)
  # 是否采用异步发送模式（实验功能）
  #publish_async: false

  # Defines how often the spooler is flushed. After idle_timeout the spooler is
  # Flush even though spool_size is not reached.
  # spooler的超时时间，如果到了超时时间，spooler也会清空发送出去（不论是否到达容量的阈值）
  #idle_timeout: 5s

  # Name of the registry file. Per default it is put in the current working
  # directory. In case the working directory is changed after when running
  # filebeat again, indexing starts from the beginning again.
  # 记录filebeat处理日志文件的位置的文件，默认是在启动的根目录下
  #registry_file: .filebeat

  # Full Path to directory with additional prospector configuration files. Each file must end with .yml
  # These config files must have the full filebeat config part inside, but only
  # the prospector part is processed. All global options like spool_size are ignored.
  # The config_dir MUST point to a different directory then where the main filebeat config file is in.
  # 如果要在本配置文件中引入其他位置的配置文件，可以写在这里（需要写完整路径），但是只处理prospector的部分
